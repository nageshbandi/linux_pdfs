Q: What is Docker?
A: Docker is an open-source containerization platform that allows you to package, distribute, and run applications and services in lightweight, portable containers.

Docker containers provide an isolated environment for running applications, which means that the application can run consistently and reliably across different machines and environments. Docker containers also allow for easy deployment and scaling of applications, as well as faster development and testing cycles.
